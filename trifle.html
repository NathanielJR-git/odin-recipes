    <h1>Easy Red, White, and Blue Trifle</h1>
    <img src="trifle.jpeg" rel="Trifle Photo" width="600">
    <p>I call this easy red, white, and blue trifle an “assembly recipe,” because very little cooking is involved. Fresh fruit, yogurt, and berry syrup are layered in a clear bowl for a beautiful presentation. Layer in as much fruit as your bowl will hold, for a refreshing and easy summer dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 purchased angel food cake, cut into bite-sized pieces, divided</li>
        <li>32 ounces sweetened vanilla yogurt, divided</li>
        <li>1 pint strawberries, hulled and sliced, or more for a larger bowl, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 cup strawberry preserves</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons water,  or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups blueberries, rinsed and dried</li>
        <li>3/4 cup blueberry preserves</li>
        <li>whole strawberries and blueberries for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a layer of angel food cake pieces in the bottom of a small trifle dish or pretty cut glass bowl. Spread a thin layer of yogurt over cake layer.</li>
        <li>Add a single layer of sliced strawberries. Place strawberry preserves and 1 tablespoon water in a microwave-safe bowl and heat on High until preserves liquefy, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir, and add up to 1 tablespoon more water if needed to make a syrup. Drizzle a portion of strawberry syrup over strawberry layer.</li>
        <li>Add another single layer of cake pieces, and spread with yogurt. Sprinkle with blueberries.</li>
        <li>Place blueberry preserves and 1 tablespoon water in a microwave-safe bowl and heat on High until preserves have melted, about 1 minute. Stir, and add up to 1 tablespoon more water if needed to make a syrup. Drizzle a portion of blueberry syrup over blueberries.</li>
        <li>Add another layer of cake pieces; spread with yogurt, add a layer of strawberries, and drizzle with strawberry syrup. Add a layer of cake; spread with yogurt, sprinkle with blueberries, and drizzle with blueberry syrup. Spread with a final layer of yogurt.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh strawberry slices, whole berries, and blueberries, and drizzle with any remaining syrup.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Store leftovers, covered, in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
